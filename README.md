# Lilac

A very basic Minecraft username claimer.

## Usage

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Install dependencies: `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `py lilac.py` and put in the fields as prompted.
4. Wait, there's no guarantee that it will work, especially if it's a name people want. This is more useful for names that are not popular and have a long drop range.
5. You can double click on `lilac_headless.pyw` to run it in the background. It will output data via notifications. (Windows only)
